# static-ls

static-ls is a hie and hiedb based language server heavily inspired by `halfsp`.

The goal of static-ls is to provide a high-speed, low-memory solution for
large projects for which haskell-language-server tends to take up too much
memory on recompilation. Haskell-language-server is recommended if you are
not experiencing these issues. `static-ls` is meant to work on enterprise
size projects. `static-ls` tends to work better standalone as a code navigation tool
since project edits require re-indexing of hie files but also works
reasonably well for editing with a program such as `ghcid` to watch files for
compilation and the `-fdefer-type-errors flag`.

In the future we plan to use interface files to fetch documentation information
as well as possibly other static sources of information

## Usage

1. Compile your project with ide info `-fwrite-ide-info` and `-hiedir .hiefiles`
  - If you're using hpack you can add:
    ```
      ghc-options:
        - -fwrite-ide-info
        - -hiedir .hiefiles
    ```
    to  your `package.yaml`
    See this project's `package.yaml` or `static-ls.cabal` for examples

    For better re-indexing while editing `-fdefer-type-errors` is also recommended - note however that this will cause type errors to be surfaced as warnings but will allow hie files to be regenerated on a failed compile
2. Index your project in hiedb running `hiedb -D .hiedb index .hiefiles --src-base-dir .`
    from your workspace root
3. Point your language client to the `static-ls` binary and begin editing!
    (See [Editor Setup](#editor-setup) for instructions if you're not sure how)

`ghcid` is recommended to refresh hie files

## Features

static-ls supports the following lsp methods:
- `textDocument/references`
- `textDocument/hover`
- `textDocument/definition`

## Limitations
- Must be compiled on the same version of ghc as the project
- You will need to re-index your hie files once you edit your project
